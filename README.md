# CS290 FINAL PROJECT 
cs290 Winter 2024 Final Project


# WEBPAGE NOTES  

I got the NASA API to work when page first loads, but then using breadcrumbs to 
navigate back "home" breaks the API... sometimes it works flawlessly... ugh. I fixed it and it works now. I did not understand the significance of the backtick (`)  

The search function kind of works to search for known pages, using key and value pairs. There are essentially 3 search terms available: "sitemap," "graph," and "help."  

This webpage is run using a python server broadcasting on port 8000  

I have found working within node.js to be very difficult. I began designing my final project inside of node.js, but everything seemed so baffling to me. I think I just need more practice, because the python server approach is very easy for me to wrap my head around. One thing I liked about Node.js was the ability to get to my site by just typing in my IP address and the port. It also was able to give me json info if my javascript wasn't working properly.  

No matter what, I need more practice. The interaction of these languages is obviously nuanced and there is a lot to learn. To be honest I had hoped to get a true website up with github pages, but MTH254 has really kept me against the ropes this term. But the dream is still alive! I will get that done, even just for a personal "professional" page! I really will need one.  


# 2. Re-review of 1st week sites  

1. Stallman.org - Stallman has made some design updates since the beginning of the term! It looks good! I would critique the choice of plain white
as a background, but that is about all I have to say. There could be improvements in the menu department, but the design works.  

2. pcpartpicker.com - I was very nit-picky in trying to find bad things about this site, it works great, and it looks great. I will continue to use the site. Some things could still be a little more intuitive, but it's not easy to know what is intuitive when you created everything.      

3. reddit.com - I have lost some respect for reddit since the beginning of the term. They are usable and presentable, but knowing how 
much money they have made makes it hard to excuse the lazy layout. My projects over this term were no better, but I have not been 
developing for 10+ years.  

4. youtube.com - I still miss my Antarctica stories. I am very impressed by the ability of youtube to keep their videos up and running when 
they reportedly recieve 30K hours of video per day. I am also very impressed by the ability for the user to customize their ways to view the page. I have inspected a lot more sites over the term, and it is very useful to just look at the styling of other programmers. Youtube is one I may want to inspect.    

5. coinbase.com - This team has made a very successful niche for themselves, but the site is lacking in customer service. I recently went through a ticket-creation 
process for my mom, and they do not make it easy. After 2 days, I still have not gotten a support ticket officially submitted. As for the rest of the site, It all 
seems to work fine. Layout is really great, and responsive. SOme UI improvements could always be made, but this one works well.   

# 3. Review of my own websites

1. For week one, I made a very basic page that really had no functionality at all. I lucked into reading about iframe, and had a lot of fun with that. Overall the design is bad. It doesn't work for mobile, and the white background hurts the eyes.  

2. Assignment 02 has a the beginnings of a fan website, but I had only just started figuring out background images, and I would say my implementation of the background is a fail. The rest seems okay, on the face. The worst thing about this assignment is that it has no functinality. You can only look at the pictures.  

3. I think around the time of Assignemnt 03 is when I started to learn some things that allowed me to add some functionality to my site. Even though it is just navigation, it adds a lot to the feel of a complete site. The layout is better, and it's possible to see the articles or anchors, or other things on the screen.  

4. Assignment 04 is when I implemented a "review" process using post and get that almost works. I wish I had found a way to perpetually save the reviews, other than saving it as a local file, then loading that file on each visit to the site. The layout is much the same from Assignment 03, with some minor changes. I personally like the color scheme!  

5. Assignment 05 For this assignment, I was able to take data from the client and send it and receive it. The css stylesheet was not working properly for me now, but I am running from a backup, so I am not 100% sure that is the case with the version I handed in. Also, I was able to implement an API to show the current price of doge, which I think worked out quite nicely. One improvement could be to use a legitimate API that has a legitimate key.

6. Final project. I had a heck of a time creating this site. I kept making plans, then running into dead ends. I had difficulty finding tools to use for crypto APIs and things of that nature, which is why I added the NASA photo, because that is one of the few API's I could find that was absolutely free. I am very pleased with having made a pseudo search function. It needs work and a real parser, but it is the beginning of a search tool.

# OVERALL REFLECTION
Compared to the sites that I critiqued at the beginning of the term, I have a long way to go. I measure up to the quality of Stallman's page, but I am sure Stallman knows a lot more about this stuff than I do. I think I may try to develop my webpages more and get a real search function. It is rewarding to work in web design because it is a near-strictly visual medium. I get instant feedback as to whether or not my code works. I think that is an axe that cuts both ways, though, because the elation of developing a working line of code is equalled by the morose of not having a clue as to where my code might be failing.
I also wanted to say thank you for guiding us through CS290, Joseph! I had fun and learned a lot!

Sincerely, Richard Sapp, x00325051
