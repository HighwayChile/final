# assignment05 - RETURN TO DOGESPLORER  
cs290 Winter 2024 assignment 05  


# REFLECTION NOTES
"assignment05.html" file is not the same as the cgi_script  
The intended way to run this page is from a python server using cgi script, and the main file is "cgi_script.py"  
I struggled a lot with this material, but I think I was able to gain a good understanding. I think my most difficult struggle was
with the css and cgi interaction. I had used a relative path and I needed to modify it to get it to work. I was deleting my entire css
file and wondering why my page would still load with the styling somewhat working, although not completely. In the end, I figured it 
out with the help of stackoverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22588026/css-not-being-applied-in-cgi-script .



# REQUIREMENTS  

  1. Create yet another design for a web app that you would want to useâ€¦ this should go quickly for us now!  

  2. Create a web app that shows some simple server-side scripting, perhaps two buttons or forms where one calls a function on the server that writes something to a file and another that retrieves that text  

  3. Go find some plugin, module, or whatever your server-side environment uses to enhance its framework and create a website that shows off that module (perhaps by going through a tutorial for that module?).  

  4. Remember to submit a link to a repo or a copy of your code to Moodle!  


# DESIGN  

I feel more comfortable making a new Dogesplorer site with the tools I have been shown over the 
past few weeks. I am still not 100% sure how I might access the blockchain information, but I know 
I could set up a simple web API that uses the information from dogechain.info. I plan on using internet 
resources, most notably w3schools, geeksforgeeks, stackoverflow, and chatGPT. I will make better comments, and plan to 
streamline styling. NOTE - I have found that "streamlining styling" won't happen if I want total control.    

another resource I must use is the "Web API" one on dogechain.info, switched to coingecko for API info.
