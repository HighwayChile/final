# CS290 FINAL PROJECT 
cs290 Winter 2024 Final Project


# WEBPAGE NOTES  

I got the NASA API to work on first load, but then using breadcrumbs to 
navigate back "home" breaks the API... sometimes it works flawlessly... ugh. I think it works now. I did not understand the significance of the backtick (`)  

The search function kind of works to search for known pages, using key and value pairs. There are essentially 3 search terms available: "sitemap," "graph," and "help."  

This webpage is run using a python server broadcasting on port 8000  

I have found working within node.js to be very difficult. I began designing my final project inside of node.js, but everything seemed so baffling to me. I think I just need more practice, because the python server approach is very easy for me to wrap my head around.  


# 2. Re-review of 1st week sites  

1. Stallman.org - He has made some design updates since the beginning of the term! It looks good! I would critique his choice of plain white
as a background, but that is about all I have to say. There could be improvements in the menu department, but the design works.  

2. pcpartpicker.com - I was very nit-picky in trying to find bad things about this site, it works great, and it looks great. I will continue to use the site.    

3. reddit.com - I have lost respect for reddit since the beginning of the term. They are usable and presentable, but knowing how 
much money they have made makes it hard to excuse the lazy layout. My projects over this term were no better, but I have not been 
developing for 10+ years.  

4. youtube.com - I still miss my Antarctica stories. I am very impressed by the ability of youtube to keep their stuff up and running when 
they recieve something like 30K hours of video per day. I am also very impressed by the ability of the client to customize their way to view the page.  

5. coinbase.com - This team has made a very successful niche for themselves, but the site is lacking in customer service. I recently went through a ticket-creation 
process for my mom, and they do not make it easy. After 2 days, I still have not gotten a support ticket officially submitted. As for the rest of the site, It all 
seems to work fine.  

# 3. Review of my own websites

1. For week one, I made a very basic page that really had no functionality at all. I lucked into reading about iframe, and had a lot of fun with that. Overall the design is bad. It doesn't work for mobile, and the white background hurts the eyes.  

2. Assignment 02 has a the beginnings of a fan website, but I had only just started figuring out background images, and I would say my implementation of the background is a fail. The rest seems okay, on the face. The worst thing about this assignment is that it has no functinality. You can only look at the pictures.  

3. I think around the time of Assignemnt 03 is when I started to learn some things that allowed me to add some functionality to my site. Even though it is just navigation, it adds a lot to the feel of a complete site. The layout is better, and it's possible to see the articles or anchors, or other things on the screen.  

4. Assignment 04 is when I implemented a "review" process that almost works. I wish I had found a way to perpetually save the reviews, other than saving it as a local file, then loading that file on each visit to the site. The layout is much the same from Assignment 03, with some minor changes. I personally like the color scheme!  

5. Assignment 05 looks very similar ot my final project, but the functionality is much less. For this assignment, I was able to take data from the client and send it and receive it. The css stylesheet was not working properly when I went to review, but I am running from a backup, so I am not 100% sure that is the case with the version I handed in. Also, I was able to implement an API to show the "current" price of doge, which I think worked out quite nicely. One improvement could be to use a legitimate API that has a legitimate key.

6. Final project. I had a heck of a time creating this site. I kept making plans, then running into dead ends. I had difficulty finding tools to use for crypto APIs and things of that nature, which is why I added the NASA photo, because that is one of the few API's I could find that was absolutely free.
